# dotfiles config
I'm trying to find a way to better manage my dotfiles and various configs including:
- emacs
- vim
- zsh

For guidance I have been browsing through [an example on GitHub](https://github.com/hrs/dotfiles) and [an article on smalleycreateive.com](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/). 

I think the approach is to set up a dotfiles directory with your configs that you can manage with Git and then symlink the relevant files.
